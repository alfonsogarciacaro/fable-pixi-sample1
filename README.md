# Using Fable with Pixi.js

Example based on @whitetigle code: https://gist.github.com/whitetigle/a75ecc8f3d2bcab736aab1240447478a

Install Fable globally (`npm install -g fable-compiler`) and type `fable`
in this directory to compile to code to JS.

Type `npm start` to fire up a local server and open the sample web page.
